Description: Tools to solve real-world problems with multiple classes by computing the areas under ROC curve via micro-averaging and macro-averaging. The methodology is described in V. Van Asch (2013) <https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~vincent/pdf/microaverage.pdf> and Pedregosa et al. (2011) <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html>.
